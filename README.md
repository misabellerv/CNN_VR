<h1 align="center">:desktop_computer: Convolutional Neural Networks for visual recognition</h1>

## 🥑: About the project
This project contains code taken from Stanford's CNN course for visual recognition (CS231N). The course introduces from basic machine learning algorithms (manual and library implementation) to more complex convolutional network algorithms using frameworks such as pytorch and tensorflow.
Here you can find implementations with good programming practices (OOP) applied in notebooks (.ipynb) for experimentation and analysis visualization.

## :rocket: : Running the codes
The repository is divided between algorithms (KNN, SVM, etc). You can clone the repo and if you want to do your own experiments, just import the .py codes that contain the main training and testing functions in a new code that you are using your data.
